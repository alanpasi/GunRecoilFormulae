Free Recoil Energy - SAAMI

Free Recoil Energy is really kinetic energy and so can be expressed mathematically as:

F.R.E. = 1/2*M*V^2

Where:

M = is the mass (or the weight of the firearm divided by 32.17) and

V = is the velocity of the recoiling firearm,

To determine the velocity of the recoiling firearm we can use the formula:

V = 

Where:

We = Weight (in grains) of the ejecta (bullet or shot and wad column)

Ve = Velocity of ejecta in feet per second

Wpg = Weight of propellant gases

Vpg = Velocity (fps) of propellant gases

7000 = Conversion factor for grains to pounds

Wf = Weight of firearm in pounds
